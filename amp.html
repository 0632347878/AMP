Linking pages with <link>

Add the following to the non-AMP page:

<link rel="amphtml" href="https://www.example.com/url/to/amp/document.html">
And this to the AMP page:

<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.example.com/url/to/full/document.html">
If you only have one page, and that page is an AMP page, you must still add the canonical link to it, which will then simply point to itself:

<link rel="canonical" href="https://www.example.com/url/to/amp/document.html">
